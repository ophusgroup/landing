Comparing conventional ADF-STEM and 4D-STEM.

Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has become an essential tool for materials science research, where it has been applied to atomic-scale imaging, diffraction, spectroscopy, and 3D tomography of many materials. In conventional STEM imaging, we scan a converged electron probe in a 2D grid over the sample, recording 1-5 intensity values from detectors which count the electrons scattered over a large angular range. Complex electron diffraction patterns which encode a lot of atomic-scale sample information are therefore reduced to only a few measurement values in conventional STEM imaging.

However, we now have direct electron detectors which can operate at speeds up to 120,000 frames / second. These detectors allow us to record a full 2D image of the diffracted electron beam over a 2D grid of probe positions, generated a 4D dataset. We therefore coined the term four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) to describe this family of experiments.

Our group has developed many kinds of 4D-STEM experiments, including nanobeam orientation and phase mapping, inversion of multiple scattering with physics and machine learning approaches, ptychographic imaging and atomic electron tomography, and many others.
