- Associate Professor, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/)
- Center Fellow, Precourt Institute for Energy, [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/)
- Staff Scientist, [SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory](https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/)

Colin received his BSc and PhD at the University of Alberta, in Edmonton, Canada. He then worked as Project Scientist, Research Scientist and Staff Scientist at the National Center for Electron Microscopy (NCEM), part of the Molecular Foundry user facility at Lawrence Berkeley Lab. His research focuses on experimental methods, reconstruction algorithms, and software codes for simulation, analysis, and instrument design of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning TEM (STEM). He was awarded a US Department of Energy (DOE) Early Career award in 2018, and the Burton medal from the Microscopy Society of America (MSA) in 2018. He has published over 200 peer-reviewed publications, and given over 100 invited talks and workshops around the world. Colin advocates for open science and his group develops open-source scientific software such as the Prismatic STEM simulation and py4DSTEM analysis codes. He is also the editor-in-chief for the interactive web-based scientific journal [Elemental Microscopy](elementalmicroscopy.com).
