## 4DSTEM analysis  

Our group has created many tutorials for 4D-STEM analysis using py4DSTEM, our open source python toolkit for 4DSTEM.  These tutorials and example datasets can be found online:

## Elemental Microscopy

Elemental Microscopy (EM) is a new journal focused on open science, interactive content, and educational and tutorial articles for microscopy. EM is build on open source technologies including Python, Jupyter, and MyST Markdown, and is hosted by CurveNote. Colin Ophus is the editor-in-chief of EM and would be delighted to chat with you about submitting an article - please [reach out](mailto:cophus@stanford.edu) if you are interested.

## Scientific Visualization with Code

One of the most important aspects of scientific research is how we communicate our results. Colin's maxim for good scientific communication is "clarify and brevity, in that order!" An equally important aspect for scientific publications is how we visualize our results, in particular with graphs, images, movies, and 3D volumes. We can create these figures manually, plotting each result and drawing each schematic one component at a time. However this approach can be difficult to reproduce and inflexible; we often want to change our visualizations to match the specific medium of scientific publications, internet publishing on the web, or for presentation slides. We have developed some resources for students to learn new methods of scientific communication.
